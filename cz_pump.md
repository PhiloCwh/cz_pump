A Crazy Idea for Token Issuance

What if someone issues a token with the following tokenomics?

Initially, 10% of the tokens are unlocked and sold on the market. The proceeds go to the project team to build out the product/platform, marketing, salaries, etc.

Each future unlock must meet ALL of the following conditions:
1. Six months after the previous unlock.
2. ONLY IF the token price has sustained above 2x of the previous unlock price for more than 30 days immediately before the unlock.
3. Up to 5% of tokens maximum each time.

For example, if the TGE was in Jan with a price of $1, by June, if the token price is still less than $2, no more tokens can be unlocked. Let’s say the token's price was above $2 from July 4 to Aug 3, then on Aug 3, 5% more tokens can be unlocked into circulation. Say the price is $3 on Aug 3. The next earliest unlock possible is March 3 next year, and only if the price is above $6 for longer than 30 days.

The project teams have the discretion to delay or reduce the size of each unlock. If they don’t want to sell more, they don’t have to. But the maximum they can sell (unlock) each time is 5%, and then they have to wait for at least another 6 months AND the price to double again.

The project team does NOT have the discretion to shorten or increase the size of the next unlock. The tokens shall be locked by a smart contract where a third party controls the keys.

This avoids new tokens flooding the market when prices are low. It also gives the project team incentives to build for the long term.

I have no plans to issue a new token. Just an idea for discussion.
